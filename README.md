Brief description of each solution:
Ex1: Reverses an integer's digits by iteratively extracting the remainder and reconstructing the number.
Ex4: Evaluates a polynomial at value x using Horner’s Method to iterate through a list of coefficients.
Ex6: Locates the index of the first non-repeating character in a string using frequency mapping.

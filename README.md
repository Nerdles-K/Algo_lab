Brief description of each solution:
Ex1: Reverses an integer's digits by iteratively extracting the remainder and reconstructing the number.

Ex2: Use the stack's pop and push methods to implement the bracket matching

Ex3: Sort and merge adjacent intervals by checking each subinterval's start and end.

Ex4: Evaluates a polynomial at value x using Horner’s Method to iterate through a list of coefficients.

Ex5: Three methods to achieve rotation of the array and the three times reserve of segments approach is the best (Both time and space complexity)

Ex6: Locates the index of the first non-repeating character in a string using frequency mapping.
